# blackjack

A Python Blackjack simulation.
Designed to be very customizable.

## Files

The code is split into three files:

- blackjack.py which is responsible for laying out a few ground rules in forms of common classes and abstract classes
- players.py which contains basic player and dealer classes
- game.py which contains the basic game class

## Usage

In order to play the simulation run the game.py file.
By default the game class contains the interactive player which is controlled via user input.
Other classes however don't allow for input or output and thus can easily be used in a simulation.
